# Gift_wrap
Trivial C++ project from my 100-level algorithms course demonstrating construction of a class `GiftWrap.cpp` which provides functionality 
to allow a gift wrapping store to calculate the cost of wrapping various sizes of (rectangular) boxes (i.e. calculate the price of the 
gift wrap box being wrapped, the tax on the gift wrap sold, and the total cost of the gift wrap (including and/or excluding tax).

Members and functions for `GiftWrap.cpp` are prototyped in the header file `GiftWrap.h`, while the class is implemented in the test file
`GiftWrapTest.cpp`.
